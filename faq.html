            <h2>Establishing Facts And Debunking Myths</h2>
            <p>There are a lot of myths and anecdotes about COVID. To help prevent confusion and the application of beliefs not rooted in facts, let's look at some of the top most important facts and myths about COVID that everyone should be aware about.</p>

                <h3><i class="material-icons">vaccines</i>FACT: Alcohol-based sanitizers are safe for everyone to use</h3>
                <p>Alcohols in the sanitizers have not been shown to create any relevant health issues. Little alcohol is absorbed into the skin, and most products contain an emollient to reduce skin dryness. Allergic contact dermatitis and bleaching of hand hair due to alcohol are very rare adverse effects. Accidental swallowing and intoxication have been described in rare cases.</p>

            <div class="body smallcontainer">
                <h3><i class="material-icons">vaccines</i>FACT: The amount of alcohol-based sanitizer you use matters</h3>
                <p>Apply a palmful of alcohol-based sanitizer to cover all surfaces of your hands. Rub your hands together using the right technique until they are dry.

                    The entire procedure should last 20-30 seconds.</p>

                <h3><i class="material-icons">vaccines</i>FACT: It is safer to frequently clean your hands and not wear gloves</h3>
                <p>Wearing gloves risks transferring germs from one surface to another and contaminating your hands when removing them. Wearing gloves does not replace cleaning hands. Health workers wear gloves only for specific tasks.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="body smallcontainer">
                <h3><i class="material-icons">vaccines</i>FACT: Vitamin and mineral supplements cannot cure COVID-19</h3>
                <p>Micronutrients, such as vitamins D and C and zinc, are critical for a well-functioning immune system and play a vital role in promoting health and nutritional well-being.  There is currently no guidance on the use of micronutrient supplements as a treatment of COVID-19.

                    WHO is coordinating efforts to develop and evaluate medicines to treat COVID-19.</p>

                <h3><i class="material-icons">health_and_safety</i>MYTH: The COVID-19 virus can be spread through mosquito bites</h3>
                <p>To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.</p>

            <div class="body smallcontainer">
                <h3><i class="material-icons">vaccines</i>FACT: Hand dryers are NOT effective in killing the COVID-19 virus</h3>
                <p>Hand dryers are not effective in killing the COVID-19 virus. To protect yourself, frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer.</p>

                <h3><i class="material-icons">vaccines</i>FACT: People of all ages can be infected by the COVID-19 virus</h3>
                <p>Older people and younger people can be infected by the COVID-19 virus. Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease are more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. 

                    WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.</p>

                <h3><i class="material-icons">vaccines</i>FACT: Antibiotics CANNOT prevent or treat COVID-19
                    Antibiotics work only against bacteria, not viruses.</h3>
                <p>COVID-19 is caused by a virus, and therefore antibiotics should not be used for prevention or treatment.

                    Some people who become ill with COVID-19 can also develop a bacterial infection as a complication. In this case, antibiotics may be recommended by a health care provider.</p>
